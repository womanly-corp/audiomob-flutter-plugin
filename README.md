## Overview

AudioMob Flutter is a wrapper API over native [AudioMob SDK](https://audiomob.com/) for seamless audio ad monetization in Flutter applications.

⚠️ This project is still in its early stages, and some features may be missing or bugged.

## Features

- 🎵 Seamless audio ad integration
- 🔄 Background playback support (only)
- ⚡ Simple API for ad management
- 📱 Android platform support
- 🎮 Perfect for games and apps

## Installation

First, make sure you have access to the AudioMob SDK. If you don't have access, please go to [AudioMob](https://audiomob.com/) and sign up.

1. Add `audioadmob` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     audioadmob:
       git:
         url: https://github.com/womanly-corp/audiomob-flutter-plugin
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Setup Android plugin in your Flutter project to provide private AAR file:

   a. Create new folder `audiomob-plugin` in your Android project (use path `android`).

   b. Add `audiomob-plugin/build.gradle.kts` to the new `audiomob-plugin` folder with the following content:

   ```gradle.kts
   configurations.maybeCreate("default")
   artifacts.add("default", file("AudiomobSDK_v3.0.0.aar"))

   group = "com.audiomobplugin"
   ```

   c. Add `AudiomobSDK_v3.0.0.aar` to the `audiomob-plugin` folder

   d. Add `include ':audiomob-plugin'` to your android root `settings.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   include ':audiomob-plugin'
   include ':app'
   ```

4. Add required permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you synced your project with Gradle files with Android Studio.
- Always verify that Ad is available using `getAdAvailability()` before calling `requestAndPlay()`.

## Usage

### Initialize the package

```dart
import 'package:audioadmob/audioadmob.dart';

// Initialize with your credentials
await Audiomob.instance.init(
  apiKey: "your_api_key",
  bundleId: "your_bundle_id",
  isBackgroundModeEnabled: true
);
```
